# DFG Viewer

The DFG Viewer is a free browser web service for displaying digitized books from remote library repositories in a rich and dynamic environment. It has an [OAI-PMH interface](http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.html) for exchanging meta- and structural data in the [METS](http://www.loc.gov/standards/mets/) and [IIIF](https://iiif.io/technical-details/) formats.

As a result, users are provided with a uniform interface for viewing and interacting with digitized media. They can browse documents, view and download the individual digital representations (images and text) in various resolutions and use further enhanced options if the library provides additional data.

The DFG Viewer is based on the free CMS [TYPO3](https://typo3.org/) and the Digital Library Framework of [Kitodo.Presentation](https://github.com/kitodo/kitodo-presentation). It can be used free of charge by anyone interested. This can either be done via the web service operated by the [Saxon State and University Library Dresden](https://www.slub-dresden.de/) or by means of a local implementation. You can find comprehensive documentations, examples and useful tips regarding both application scenarios at the [project's home page](https://dfg-viewer.de/).

Older releases can be found on [Launchpad](https://launchpad.net/dfg-viewer).

The development of the DFG Viewer is predominantly funded by the [German Research Foundation](https://www.dfg.de/).
